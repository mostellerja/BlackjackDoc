**Console Blackjack in C#**
===========================

Introduction
------------
Blackjack is a very popular card game 
where the player attempts to get a combination
of cards where their collective number values are less 
than or equal to 21.  If the player has a value over 21,
they automatically lose, or otherwise known as "busted".

Description
-----------
As a fan of the game Blackjack, I wanted to make a virtual
version for myself to play whenever I had the desire to. So I decided 
to make a version of Blackjack that operates within the terminal 
console of any computer. Console Blackjack was created in C#, a 
popular programming language that developers use when coding games.
Console Blackjack was coded within the Microsoft Visual Studio environment.
At the start of the game, the player is given two cards with numerical
values, which are generated randomly within each game. If the player decides to 
"hit", they are given another randomly-generated card value which is added to their
total. The total of the dealer is also randomly generated, meaning that the outcome 
of the game is never certain until it is finished. 

Here is a small section of code that shows the random nature of the cards:
